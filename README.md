the easiest way to make our html elements modals (so that they appear as dialog windows above the other elements)

#Just clone this repo or download the zipped source code and embed iswa.modal.css in the head of your html file with the tag link
and also integrate the script above your body (at the end or after all the elements)
<script src="./iswa.modal/iswa.modal.js"></script>
